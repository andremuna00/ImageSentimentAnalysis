# üì∑ Image Sentiment Analysis with CNNs  

## üåü Overview  
This project uses two complementary approaches for image sentiment analysis:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Predicts sentiment from images while providing interpretability through heat maps that highlight key regions influencing the predictions.
- Image Captioning with GPT: Generates captions for images to extract contextual sentiment, leveraging language-based sentiment analysis.
